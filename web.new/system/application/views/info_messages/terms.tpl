<h3>9. Indemnification</h3>
<p>Customer shall indemnify and defend GoodList, its Partners, agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third party claim or liability (collectively, "Liabilities"), arising out of Use, Customer's Program use, Targets, Creative and Services and breach of the Agreement. Partners shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of the above Partner indemnity. </p><br>

<h3>10. Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces any other applicable agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter hereof. Any conflicting or additional terms contained in additional documents (e.g. reference to a purchase order number) or oral discussions are void. Each party shall not disclose the terms or conditions of these Terms to any third party, except to its professional advisors under a strict duty of confidentiality or as necessary to comply with a government law, rule or regulation. Customer may grant approvals, permissions, extensions and consents by email, but any modifications by Customer to the Agreement must be made in a writing executed by both parties. Any notices to GoodList must be sent to GoodList, 209 Abbott Street, Vancouver BC, Canada, V6B 2K7, with a copy sent via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt. Notice to Customer may be effected by sending email to the email address specified in Customer's account, or by posting a message to Customer's account interface, and is deemed received when sent (for email) or no more than 15 days after having been posted (for messages in Customer's account interface). A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default. Unenforceable provisions will be modified to reflect the parties' intention and only to the extent necessary to make them enforceable, and remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect. Customer may not assign any of its rights hereunder and any such attempt is void. GoodList and Customer and GoodList and Partners are not legal partners or agents, but are independent contractors. In the event that these Terms or an Advertising Program expire or is terminated, GoodList shall not be obligated to return any materials to Customer.</p>
